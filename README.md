# gpx-to-csv
Designed to take a GPX file and output a CSV file that contains the name, date, length (in miles or kilometers), elevation (in meters or feet), total time and moving time of all the tracks in the GPX file. Build it so it would work with Gaia GPS files but it should work for every GPX.
## Pre-reqs
Requires ``gpxpy`` which you can install with ``pip``.
## Usage
```
$ python3 convert.py [gpx-file]
```
where ``[gpx-file]`` is the file you want to turn into a CSV.
## Output
Will product a CSV file with the same name as the input GPX file. The expected output will look something like this:

Name | Date | Length (mi) | Elevation (ft) | Total Time | Moving Time
---- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- | -----------
